My RedwoodJS-based application, named "Trackside Home Row Seats", is similar to AirBnB. However, it services a rental need that AirBnB does not primarily focus on. My application allows users to rent seats in peoples' homes or boats that have an unobstructed view of an auto racing track that is part of a street circuit. To put this into context, a few Formula 1 races occur on street circuits that run along public streets. Some street circuits are surrounded by peoples' homes and/or bodies of water utilized by toats. The owners of houses or boats which provide views of the race tracks sell seats on various websites, but most of the marketing seems to be driven by word of mouth. There is no centralized or dedicated platform for this type of service. My application solves this problem by having a dedicated website for the sellers (owners of homes and boats along street-circuit courses) and potential buyers (racing fans).
